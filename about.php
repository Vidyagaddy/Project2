<p><b>About Vidya Gaddy</b><br>
I am a Computer Science major with a concentration in Human Centered Computing. I'm a third year student at CSU currently
taking Web Development and Human Computer Interaction. I am also taking several psychology classes this semester and
participating in research. I'm also working 20 hours a week as a supervisor, so I'm very busy all the time. That being said
I want to do professional web development work in the
future so I am eager to learn everything I can as fast as I can manage. I have never been to South Carolina and I do not plan to go
but I think there are plenty of spots for others to consider.

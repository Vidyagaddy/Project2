UFO Welcome Center

https://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/10911

This attraction is designed for aliens by humans. 
It is shaped like a flying saucer with a smaller flying saucer on top.
It is falling apart but it's caretaker is committed to keeping it open.
It welcomes visiters from all corners of the universe (including humans).
The point of this place is to create an environment that aliens would feel comfortable in,
not so much for humans. It's covered in wires and gadgets from ceiling to floor. 


About me

I am a Computer Science major with a concentration in Human Centered Computing. I'm a third year student at CSU currently
taking Web Development and Human Computer Interaction. I am also taking several psychology classes this semester and 
participating in research. I'm also working 20 hours a week as a supervisor, so I'm very busy all the time. That being said
I want to do professional web development work in the 
future so I am eager to learn everything I can as fast as I can manage. I have never been to South Carolina and I do not plan to go
but I think there are plenty of spots for others to consider.
